# This script has a bug that it only finds the active volume sink if I'm
# currently playing music on it.

# I'm not using something like `pactl set-sink-volume "@DEFAULT_SINK@" +10%`
# because the default sink is my built-in audio regardless of the fact that
# audio plays from my audio adapter (this happens e.g. after `pulseaudio -k`).

# I'm not using `amixer -q sset Master 10%+` because this will lead to the
# left/ right audio to diverge in volume.

pactl list short sinks | grep RUNNING | cut -f1
